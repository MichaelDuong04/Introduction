# Introduction
Hello! I'm Michael Duong, a student at the University of Texas at Austin. This GitHub showcases the projects I've developed throughout my academic journey and personal explorations in programming.
While some of my collaborative work remains private due to shared ownership, I'm always happy to discuss these projects in more detail. Feel free to reach out to me at mduong2788@gmail.com if you'd like to learn more about my experience or any specific projects!
